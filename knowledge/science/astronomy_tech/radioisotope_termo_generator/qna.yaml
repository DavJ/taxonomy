- answer: Space exploration missions require safe, reliable, long-lived power systems to provide electricity and heat to spacecraft and their science instruments
  question: What space exploration requires?
- answer: In June 2003, the Department of Energy (DOE) awarded the MMRTG contract to a team led by Aerojet Rocketdyne.
  question: Was there any reward for MMRTG.
- answer: A temperature gradient generates an electron flow in the system. Unlike photovoltaic solar arrays, RTGs are not dependent upon solar energy, so they can be used for deep space missions.
  question: What does temperature gradient do with electron in the system
- answer: The MMRTG was developed by an industry team of Aerojet Rocketdyne and Teledyne Energy Systems.
  question: Who developed MMRTG project?
- answer: A MMRTG was successfully launched into space on July 30, 2020, aboard the Mars 2020 mission, and is now being used to supply the scientific equipment on the Perseverance rover with heat and power.
  question: When was MMRTG launched?
